# Life.Code
Life displayed in Code format


## To Run:
***DO NOT*** try to run this - it is not yet finished

## Idea:
The idea is that i put my life into Code as if i was coding myself.

## Example:

```
import time

while True(living == True):
    time.sleep(1)
    age_seconds = age_seconds + 1
    if age_seconds == 60:
        age_minute = age_minute + 1
        age_seconds = 0

```

## In future:

- add images for what state in life there at.
- add random facts (e.g. when you get to age 40 say something to do with the age 40)
- add a life calendar; cross off a week once it has been done (only available in realtime mode.)


- ~~be able to speed up time (1x is defualt but you can do 2x, 5x, 10x, 100x;) {i.e. 2x will mean a "minute" in game will last 30 seconds in the real world.}~~
